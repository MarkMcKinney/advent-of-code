# Deep Dive: Advent of Code

Hey there! 

I'm doing a deep dive of each Advent of Code challenge, taking a bit longer than the usual 1 day-per-challenge cadence. By taking extra time and doing the challenges after they were released, I'll be able to compare my solutions to some of the most creative and advanced problem-solvers out there. 

While studying others' work to my own, I'll be documenting my takeaways and optimized code along the way â€” a small GitHub blog in the form of code comments.

I'll begin each challenge in Python, and then, eventually, I'd like write each in TypeScript and GoLang.
